  4. If the user query includes phrases like "change", "update", or "modify" related to a character's details, use the `update_character` intent.
  5. Output format:
  {
    "intent": "recognized-intent-or-unknown",
    "agents": {
      "agent_1": "agent_name",
      "agent_2": "agent_name"
    }

  1. Set the fields based on the provided information from {{USER_QUERY}} and {{USER_IDENTIFIERS}}
  2. All tools provided from the intent should be given their own tasks
  3. Always place the tools in the order they are listed in the intent, so task_1 is the first tool listed in the intent, task_2 is the second tool, etc.
  4. character_tags should be attached to the character name after the #.
    a. If create_character is the intent, create a random 4 digit numeric character tag for the character.
